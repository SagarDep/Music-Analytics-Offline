# MusicLogger

Hobby Personal Project 

I plan to build music logger which will run continuously on your device 24x7 and will log all the media which you play (including youtube videos) and then application will display the info in nice statistical manner (Pie charts and stuff) 

It will help you see your music (and youtube) listening habits like your most listened artist recently (or month before), trend of genres in your music listening and stuff like that. 

Last.fm provides this kind of functionlity already but what they lack is youtube analytics and offline capability. This app will store data locally (and in future maybe provision for storing data in drive or something). Only you will have access to your music listening habits. (And me if I decide to steal your data, wink wink) 

I want to build this project for couple of reasons 

1. This thought came in my mind while having shower. You should never ignore your shower idea. Most of the billion dollar ideas and all of other shitty idea come from there.
2. I want to create best architectural design for this app so as to learn good architectural design in android along the way!
3. Because I can!

Sounds interesting?
